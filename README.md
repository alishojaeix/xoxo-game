# xoxo-game
The "XOXO" game, also known as Tic-Tac-Toe, is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. One player uses "X" and the other uses "O". The objective is to be the first to get three of your marks in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

#how to play 

1.The game starts by displaying an empty 3x3 grid.

2.Players take turns entering the row and column numbers (0-2) where they want to place their mark ("X" or "O").

3.After each move, the board is updated and displayed.

4.The game checks for a winner after every move. If a player gets three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal, they win.
